Hi, I’m @ARCATECMACARTHUR

• I’m interested in theoretical concepts related to consciousness, memory, quantum processes, and meaning. I also engage in art and pseudo-academic activities in the fields of physics, philosophy, and psychology.
• I’m currently learning about advanced problem-solving frameworks and creating practical applications for my novel algebraic calculus, Intellidoscope,

•X ( z q() Z ()Q z ) Y• 

along with another tool I've developed called The Orderring, which is a static image of concentric discs that aid in categorization and in which Intellidoscope  works as an orientation vector over the top. 
Both tools are part of my overarching project
'Domains Of Being'.
• I’m looking to collaborate on projects that explore the intersection of quantum mechanics and cognitive science.
• Fun fact: I enjoy developing innovative mathematical models and frameworks on paper in my spare time.
